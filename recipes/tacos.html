            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

            <li>3 pounds trimmed skirt steaks</li>

            <li>16 (6inch) white corn tortillas or as needed</li>

            <li>1 white onion, chopped or to taste</li>

            <li>1 small bunch of fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Now that you have everything you need, let's get into the kitchen and start cooking!!</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
              <li class="first-taco-step">Combine orange juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, and cayenne in a large freezer bag. Submerge skirt steaks in the marinade. Seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate, 1 to 8 hours.</li>

              <li>Preheat a grill to medium-high. Grill the steaks until hot and firm in the center or to your preferred doneness, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a flat work surface and slice as thinly as possible against the grain.</li>

              <li class="third-taco-step">Heat corn tortillas on the grill or in a microwave. Keep tortillas warm in a folded sheet of aluminum foil covered by a thick towel.</li>

              <li>Add steak to each tortilla and top with white onion and cilantro.</li>

        <p><h6>THAT'S IT!</h6></p>

          </ol>
